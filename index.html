            <p>The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering (DECE) is one of the largest departments in the
                Gokongwei College of Engineering at De La Salle University. Currently, the department has twenty-six
                academic personnel, one non-academic personnel, and eight support personnel providing technical,
                professional and administrative services. Different laboratories have been established for each area of
                specialization. A number of specialized modern research equipment was acquired from the Department of
                Science and Technology through the Engineering and Science Education Program. The equipment is used by
                the personnel and students for research and development.</p>
            <p>The Research Center of the Department will also provide consultancy services to industry, it also
                conducts industrially relevant research. During the starting phase, the Center will identify research
                areas which have elements of research, service, and development. The results from the research in an
                identified area should be available as a service to our local industry. Aside from undertaking
                collaborative research projects with industry, the Research Center of the ECE department also aims to
                train industry-oriented researchers and engineers through seminars or short course training.</p>
            <h2><b>Vision-Mission Statement of the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering</b></h2>
            <h3 id="vision">Vision Statement</h3>
            <p>The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering offers Electronics Engineering (ECE) and Computer
                Engineering (CpE) programs. The department envisions the ECE and CpE graduates as competent and ethical
                professionals in the area they have chosen.  For the ECE, the areas are in Electronics, Communications,
                and Digital Signal Processing.  For the CpE, the areas are in Embedded Systems, Computer Hardware
                Architecture, Computer Networks, Multimedia Systems and Machine Learning.</p>
            <h3 id="mission">Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>The Mission of the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering is to mold and nurture ECE and CpE
                professional engineers  with strong sense of nationalism and who are highly competent in various field
                of electronics, communications and computer such as telecommunications, broadcasting and other
                communications engineering technologies; industrial electronics  and instrumentation; semiconductor
                applications, manufacture and test engineering; systems analysis and controls engineering, software and
                hardware engineering, especially the students, towards becoming:</p>
