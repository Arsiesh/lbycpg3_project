                    to design an antenna system.

                    This course introduces the key concepts in data networks and
                    related communications technologies. The main emphasis is on the
                    building blocks of the Internet and other TCP/IP-based data
                    network services. The course is relevant as it covers the
                    principles behind the infrastructure on which the global society
                    is increasingly relying upon.

                    The course covers the practical aspects of communications in data
                    networks. Hands-on activities will allow the students to be
                    involved in applying the principles of and demonstrating the
                    operation of TCP/IP-based data networks. The student will be
                    exposed to data network equipment, tools, and methodologies as
                    well as various aspects of design of such systems.

                    The course provides the student an opportunity to practice design
                    in a way that parallels what will be encountered in professional
                    practice. It requires students to apply a systematic design
                    process and incorporate multiple and realistic constraints such as
                    engineering codes, standards, and realistic constraints that
                    include economic, environmental, sustainability,
                    manufacturability, ethical, health and safety, social, and
                    political considerations in solving the design problem.

                    In this laboratory course, the students obtain hands-on experience
                    on the practical aspects of the theoretical concepts of broadcast
                    engineering and acoustics. The experiments involve sound level
                    meter, loudspeakers, microphones, sound cancellation and
                    reinforcement. It also involves audio recording and mixing. The
                    broadcast engineering part covers AM and FM antenna design.

                    On-the-Job training will expose the students to the different
                    works that an electronic engineer performs. This includes exposure
                    to communications equipment design and operations, electronic
                    parts and components manufacturing, industrial or power plants, IT
                    related functions, research activities, design projects and

                    THSEC13 is the final stage of the thesis project. The students are
                    expected to finish the prototype, to complete the rest of the
                    document, and to comply with all the requirements such as passing
                    the defense, joining the forum and participating in the exhibit.
                    All thesis groups who intend to defend on the current term should
                    submit a Letter of Intent to the thesis coordinator before the
                    last day of dropping of subject. A copy of the final thesis draft
                    must be given to the adviser for proofreading. All the thesis
                    groups that have passed the thesis defense and have satisfied all
                    revisions shall submit to the thesis coordinator.
